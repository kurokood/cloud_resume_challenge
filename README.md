## Overview
[](https://github.com/kurokood/cloud_resume_challenge/blob/master/site-sc.png)
This portfolio site is inspired by the concepts of the Cloud Resume Challenge by Forrest Brazeal. It demonstrates a foundational understanding of serverless architecture through a practical, hands-on project. The system architecture is illustrated below.

In this project, I provisioned a personal static portfolio site hosted on Amazon S3, integrated with Amazon CloudFront for content delivery and a custom domain managed via Route 53. The site also features a visitor counter implemented using API Gateway, an AWS Lambda function, and Amazon DynamoDB for storing visit data.

NOTE: I provisioned the entire infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform.

You can use the information and instructions below to replicate this project and gain hands-on experience with core Terraform and AWS concepts.
Happy learning! ☁️
